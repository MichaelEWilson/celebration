                        <p>The Michael J. Roulette scholarship fund was established this year in honor of Pastor Tom’s nephew and former student and former Camp Rock instructor, who passed away in 2022. A limited number of full or partial Camp Rock scholarships are available for those who need financial assistance. Applicants will first read the following bio on Michael. In 200 words or less, please tell the scholarship committee why you are deserving of a scholarship, and please include one thing about Michael Roulette that you found personally inspirational. Application essays can be emailed to <a href="mailto:brittany@celebrationlive.net">brittany@celebrationlive.net</a> to be sent to the scholarship team.</p>

                        <h3>Michael Jedediah Roulette</h3>
                        <p><strong>December 28, 1985&ndash;August 22, 2022</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Friend, gentle soul &amp; musician</strong></p>    
                    </div>
                        
                    <p>Michael is the nephew of Pastor Tom Bartlett and has helped in music training and Camp Rock in Maryland. Michael was a gentle soul and kind to everyone. He didn’t know he would love music so much, but after spending time with his uncle and family in FL one summer, he went home with the basics of drumming and a drum set. That summer set Michael on a path to learn and play music. Michael pursued not only the drums but also keyboards and vocals. In time Michael studied music at a local college and became an instructor at Bach to Rock school of music in Maryland. This fulfilled a lifelong dream of sharing his music with young players. While Michael was raised in a Christian family, it wasn’t until his latter years that he made his faith an integral part of his life. Christian music, especially from groups like DC talk was instrumental in his faith formation. Michael passed on to heaven one night after teaching and on his way home. A respiratory issue caused him to pull his car over, ensuring no one else could be harmed by his vehicle. There in his car parked, he left this world for his eternal home. There was a plan to bring Michael to Camp Rock 2023, but he passed before that could happen. A scholarship in Michael’s honor and memory has been established to help young musicians grow in their skills and faith. </p>
